source envVV/bin/activate

----------
First we check the list of packages installed in our virtual environment 
    pip list


To install new libraries, you can easily just pip install the libraries. The virtual environment will make use of its own pip, so you don't need to use pip3.
After installing your required libraries, you can view all installed libraries by using pip list, or you can generate a text file listing all your project dependencies by running the code below:

pip freeze > requirements.txt



 pip install -r requirements.txt
